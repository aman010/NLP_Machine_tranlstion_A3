Please visit https://gevz9w7hsz4zbkblhrkw8t.streamlit.app/ link for the refernce to the work please note that input text will only translate the word in vocab OOV is not added


* The application is very simple once you select the target senetence from parllel translation of text and click translate it gives you the translated output in hinfi
* Another way write the input box once you write in the input box it will take source text and generate the random text for translation
* We tried to loop accross all the target sentences and find near by BLEU score to find the nearby corpus with best alignments but that will take lots of time considering the tome we have




The images below is for reference from the notebook although we are not able to find proper way to words in target langauge we add the text. There more interesting translation which happened in the notebook
Regarding the performance the Additive model id better, we tried couple tricks like mask weight training but does not show imporvement in additive rather in Multiplicative at the marginal level.
Although the dynamism between the attention layer and decoder layer make multiplicative model hard to deign and fit in contrast to additive.

The reference of the code was taken from the provided notebook with few ideas to fit and excute the model which took almost 2 days
